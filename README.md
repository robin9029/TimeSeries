Time Series forecasting

component of timeseries:
Trend: lets say town has build, and a hardware shop build: now the increase in selling , once every one buys the sell will gradually decrease
Seasonal: New year, selling choclate increase on new year eve and can be observed in few years, eg. summer : ice cream demand increase
Irregularties: erratic ,shot duration,: like corona came and can happen erratic, covid medicine has come
Cyclic: don't have any regularaties can happen anytime , and cyclic and much harder to predict 

when not apply time series?
-when values are constant, like sell of coffie in 4 consiquitve month is constant, predict next month is not use time series
- when we have some function f(x) not use time series 

what is stationay ?
Time series is something to predict the future based on past 
1) constant mean
2) constant Variance 
3) Auto covarince should not depend upon time 

Rolling Stastics :plot moving average and see if varies with time : visual techine 

ADFC:(Dickeyâ€“Fuller test tests) Assume  Null hypothesis that time series is not stationary, test comprises of Test statistics and some critical value 
if Test statistics < some critical value  : can reject the Null hypothesis and say data is stationary

ACF: auto corelation function 
PACF: partial auto corelation function helps to determine  AR: Auto regressive & MA: moving average 

AR: forcast next timestamp by regressing over previous value
MA: Forcast the next timestamp value by averaging over the previous value 

ARIMA: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving average (AR-I-MA): -for non stationary data -allows to difference the data -Also includes a seasonal differencing parameter for seasonal non-stationary data diff1 & diff2 are to reduce diffreence make data stationary

Cross Validation on Time series:
https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-nested-cross-validation-76adba623eb9
 k-fold cross-validation and hold-out cross-validation.
 
 Arbitrary Choice of Test Set: randomly devide test & train 30:70 ratio, will may not perform good on unseen data 

Nested CV Methods for a Time Series
1. Predict Second Half
2. Day Forward-Chaining

1. Predict Second Half: train, test split  can be set can produce biased
2. a common approach is to create many train/test splits and average the errors over all the splits
